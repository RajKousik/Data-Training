# Git Integration & CI/CD Deployment in Azure

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes in the source code and helps manage the collaboration process by maintaining a history of changes, enabling branch creation for different features or environments, and merging code into the main codebase.

### Key Git Concepts:

- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage location for your project files, including their history.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the code, allowing multiple workstreams to exist simultaneously. Common branches include `main` (or `master`), `develop`, `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix`.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.
- **Merge**: The process of combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A mechanism to review and merge changes from one branch to another.

## Git Integration with Azure

Azure DevOps and GitHub are popular platforms for integrating Git with Azure services. They provide tools for source control, build automation, testing, and deployment, making it easy to manage the entire software development lifecycle.

### Steps for Integration:

1. **Create a Git Repository**: Set up a repository in Azure Repos or GitHub.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use the `git clone` command to copy the repository to your local machine.
3. **Set Up Azure Pipelines**: Create a pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate the CI/CD process.
4. **Connect to Azure**: Link your Git repository to Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery / Deployment. It is a method of automating the software development process, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

CI involves automatically building and testing your code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. It ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, reducing the chances of integration issues.

### Continuous Deployment (CD):

CD takes the output from the CI process and automatically deploys it to various environments, such as staging, testing, UAT, and production. This automation ensures that new features and bug fixes reach users quickly and reliably.

## Example CI/CD Pipeline with Multiple Stages

### Branching Strategy:

1. **Development Branch (`dev`)**:

   - Used for active development.
   - Developers create feature branches off `dev` and merge their changes back into `dev` when complete.

2. **Staging Branch (`staging`)**:

   - After code is tested in the `dev` branch, it's merged into `staging` for more comprehensive testing.
   - The `staging` branch serves as a pre-production environment.

3. **Test Branch (`test`)**:

   - Used for automated and manual testing.
   - Ensures that the code behaves as expected under various conditions.

4. **UAT Branch (`uat`)**:

   - This branch is used for User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
   - Business stakeholders validate that the changes meet their requirements.

5. **Production Branch (`main` or `production`)**:
   - Finalized and tested code is merged into the `main` branch for deployment to the live environment.
   - This is the branch that goes into production.

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages:

1. **Development Stage**:

   - Code is committed to the `dev` branch.
   - CI pipeline builds the code and runs unit tests.
   - If successful, the code is automatically merged into the `staging` branch.

2. **Staging Stage**:

   - Code in the `staging` branch is built and deployed to a staging environment.
   - Integration tests and system tests are run.
   - If all tests pass, the code is ready to be moved to the `test` branch.

3. **Test Stage**:

   - Code is deployed to a testing environment from the `test` branch.
   - Both automated and manual tests are conducted.
   - If the code passes all tests, it is moved to the `uat` branch.

4. **UAT Stage**:

   - Code is deployed to the UAT environment.
   - Business stakeholders perform UAT to ensure that the changes are correct.
   - Once approved, the code is merged into the `main` branch.

5. **Production Stage**:
   - Code from the `main` branch is deployed to the production environment.
   - Continuous monitoring ensures that the deployment was successful and that the application is functioning correctly.

## Setting Up CI/CD in Azure

### Using Azure Pipelines:

1. **Create a Pipeline**:

   - Define a pipeline in Azure DevOps using a `yaml` file or the classic editor.
   - Set up triggers to start the pipeline whenever code is pushed to specific branches.

2. **Define Jobs and Stages**:

   - Define different jobs for each stage (`build`, `test`, `deploy`) and specify the environments for each stage (`staging`, `test`, `uat`, `production`).

3. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - The pipeline runs automatically when changes are made to the corresponding branches.
   - Monitor the pipelineâ€™s progress through the Azure DevOps portal.

### Using GitHub Actions:

1. **Set Up GitHub Actions**:
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
   - Define your CI/CD workflows in `yaml` files.
2. **Trigger Actions**:
   - Define triggers such as `push` or `pull_request` to initiate the workflow.
3. **Deploy to Azure**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process by integrating with Azure services.
