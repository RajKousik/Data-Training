# Apache Airflow Introduction

## Overview

Apache Airflow, a powerful platform used for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The session covers the basics of what Apache Airflow is, why it's useful, how it works, and includes hands-on practice with key concepts like operators, XComs, branching, retries, and more.

## What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow automation tool used to manage and schedule complex data pipelines. It allows you to define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. Airflowâ€™s flexibility and scalability make it ideal for orchestrating ETL processes, managing data science workflows, and automating repetitive tasks.

## Why Use Apache Airflow?

- **Scalability**: Easily handles complex workflows with hundreds or thousands of tasks.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for dynamic pipeline creation and modification using Python.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Provides tools for monitoring workflow execution and sending alerts if something goes wrong.
- **Extensibility**: A rich ecosystem of plugins and operators for integration with different services.
- **Community Support**: Active open-source community ensuring continuous development and support.

## How Apache Airflow Works

### Core Concepts

- **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: Represents a workflow, with nodes as tasks and edges as dependencies.
- **Tasks**: The building blocks of a DAG, representing a single operation.
- **Operators**: Predefined templates that determine what each task does (e.g., executing Python code, running a Bash script).
- **Scheduler**: Responsible for executing the tasks in the correct order and managing dependencies.
- **Executor**: Manages task execution, either locally, on a cloud platform, or with a distributed system.

### Key Features Covered in the Session

1. **BashOperator**: Executes a bash command.

   - Example: Run a shell script as a task in your workflow.

2. **PythonOperator**: Executes Python code.

   - Example: Run a Python function as part of the DAG.

3. **EmptyOperator**: Used for creating a task with no action; useful for placeholders or end-of-branch markers.

   - Example: Mark the start or end of a process.

4. **XComs (Cross-communication)**: Used to share data between tasks.

   - Example: Pass a result from one task to another.

5. **Branching**: Allows for conditional execution of tasks.

   - Example: Execute different tasks based on some criteria.

6. **Retries**: Specify the number of retry attempts for failed tasks.

   - Example: Retry a task three times if it fails.

7. **Catchup**: Determines whether past DAG runs should be executed if the DAG is started after its scheduled start date.

   - Example: Skip backfill runs to avoid overloading the system.

8. **Scheduling**: Defines when a DAG runs.

   - Example: Schedule a DAG to run daily at midnight.

9. **Variables**: Allows the storage of dynamic information that can be accessed by tasks.

   - Example: Use variables to store configuration values.

10. **Triggers**: External signals that can start a DAG.

    - Example: Trigger a DAG when a file is uploaded to a specific directory.

11. **Parallel Tasks**: Execute multiple tasks simultaneously, optimizing workflow efficiency.
    - Example: Run data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks in parallel.

## Hands-On Practice

During the session, we covered practical examples to demonstrate the above concepts. These examples helped you understand how to:

- Create and configure a basic DAG.
- Use different operators to define tasks.
- Implement error handling with retries.
- Pass data between tasks using XComs.
- Manage task dependencies with branching.
- Schedule and trigger workflows.
- Utilize parallel task execution for faster processing.

### Running Apache Airflow

To get started with Apache Airflow, we used Docker to set up the environment. The following steps were followed:

1. **Docker Setup**:
   - We used the `docker-compose.yaml` file provided on the official Airflow website [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/docker-compose.yaml).
2. **Start Airflow**:
   - We ran the command `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the Airflow services.
   - This set up all necessary services including the web server, scheduler, and worker, enabling us to access the Airflow UI and start running our DAGs.

## Conclusion

Apache Airflow is a robust platform for managing complex workflows, offering flexibility, scalability, and extensibility. With a solid understanding of its core features and hands-on experience, you'll be well-equipped to build and manage data pipelines efficiently.
